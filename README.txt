This is a readme file. It outlines what is in this folder. READMEs are a good practice to follow for good data management!

This folder is the working folder for git demos. This demo folder was initially created for the mini-workshop "Getting control of version control," part of the "Love Your Research" series conducted by the Libraries and the Office of Professional Development. 

Slides were developed in Google. 

The first workshop was held on 2017-02-28.
